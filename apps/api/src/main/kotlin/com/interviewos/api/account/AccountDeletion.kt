/**
 * Deleting a candidate's account, everything in it, and the sign-in itself (PRD 12).
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` is unambiguous — "account deletion must actually delete, including storage
 * objects" — so the order here is chosen around the part that does not roll back:
 *
 * 1. **One transaction:** durable jobs are queued to purge the user's prefix in every
 *    bucket (recordings, resumes, the profile photo), and `public.users` is deleted, which
 *    cascades to every user-owned table. The jobs live outside that foreign-key tree, so
 *    they survive it. Either both happen or neither does.
 * 2. **Then the auth user** is removed through the Supabase admin API. Its row cascades to
 *    `public.users` too, so if step 1 had somehow left anything, this clears it.
 *
 * If step 2 fails, the candidate's data is already gone and their files are queued; only
 * the sign-in survives. The request fails loudly so it can be retried, and a retry is safe:
 * the jobs upsert, the row delete finds nothing, and an auth user that is already gone
 * counts as deleted. Doing it the other way round would risk the worse failure — a deleted
 * sign-in whose data nobody can reach any more, and so nobody can ask to delete.
 *
 * [userId] comes from the verified token and nowhere else; there is no way to name
 * somebody else's account.
