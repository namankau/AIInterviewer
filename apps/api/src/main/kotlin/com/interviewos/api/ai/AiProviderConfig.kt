/**
 * The ordered list of models the interview loop will try.
 *
 * Absent, it is one Gemini model and the behaviour is exactly what it was. Configured,
 * each entry is tried in order for calls it is able to serve — see [FallbackInterviewAi],
 * which is where the "able to serve" part is enforced.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * interviewos:
 *   ai:
 *     providers:
 *       - name: gemini-cheap
 *         kind: gemini
 *         model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite
 *       - name: gemini-strong
 *         kind: gemini
 *         model: gemini-3.5-flash
 *       - name: kimi
 *         kind: openai
 *         base-url: https://api.moonshot.ai/v1
 *         model: kimi-k2-0711-preview
 *         api-key: ${MOONSHOT_API_KEY:}
 * ```
 *
 * `kind: openai` means the OpenAI *wire format*, not OpenAI the vendor — Moonshot,
 * DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter and Together all speak it, so which one you get is decided
 * by `base-url` alone.
