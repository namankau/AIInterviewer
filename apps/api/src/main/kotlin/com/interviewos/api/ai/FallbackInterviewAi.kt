/**
 * Tries each provider in turn, and is honest about which ones it can try.
 *
 * The interview loop had a single point of failure: one Gemini project, one spend cap.
 * When that cap was reached the product stopped — no interviews could start, no reports
 * could be written, and the source library could not read anything.
 *
 * Two rules make this safe rather than merely redundant.
 *
 * **A provider is only offered work it can actually do.** Assessing an answer sends the
 * candidate's recorded voice; handing that to a text-only model would not degrade the
 * round, it would break it — at best an error, at worst an invented transcript scored as
 * though it were real. So each call names the capability it needs and the chain skips
 * anyone who lacks it. In practice that means the text-heavy calls can fail over to a
 * cheap text model, and answer assessment can only fail over to another *multimodal*
 * provider.
 *
 * **Only somebody else's failure is retried.** A quota refusal or an outage is worth
 * trying elsewhere. A malformed request is ours and will fail identically everywhere, so
 * it fails fast rather than being billed three times on the way to the same error.
 *
 * What this deliberately does not do is silently lower quality. Every fall-through is
 * logged with both providers named, and the provider that actually answered is what gets
 * recorded against the report — so "why is this report worse than that one" is always
 * answerable.
