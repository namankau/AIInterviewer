/**
 * Runs a candidate's code, so a DSA round has a Run button that does something.
 *
 * Execution goes to **Piston**, an open-source sandboxed runner, over its HTTP API.
 *
 * **It is off by default, because there is no free hosted Piston any more.** The public
 * instance went whitelist-only on 15 February 2026 and now answers `/execute` with a 401;
 * Wandbox, the obvious alternative, was returning `Failed to get uid` from its own sandbox
 * when this was checked. So Python runs in the candidate's browser instead, and this stays
 * as the path to real multi-language execution the moment somebody runs
 * `docker run -p 2000:2000 ghcr.io/engineer-man/piston` and sets `base-url` at it.
 *
 * That is the reason it is built against Piston's API rather than something bespoke: a
 * self-hosted instance speaks exactly this, so switching costs a URL and nothing else.
 *
 * **The candidate's code leaves our servers.** That is a real trade and the room says so
 * in as many words rather than burying it here. Nothing else about the round goes with it
 * — no transcript, no name, no session id, just the source and the input it is run on.
 *
 * Failure is never fatal to the round. A runner that is down, rate-limited or slow gives
 * back a result that says so, and the candidate carries on talking through their solution
 * — which is what they are actually assessed on. A real onsite frequently has no compiler
 * at all.
