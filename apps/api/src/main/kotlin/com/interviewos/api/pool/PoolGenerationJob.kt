/**
 * The resumable driver that fills the pool.
 *
 * **It is not scheduled and it does not start on boot.** It runs when an admin asks it to,
 * and only when `interviewos.pool.enabled` is true — two switches rather than one, because
 * this is the only thing in the product that spends money with nobody waiting on the other
 * end, and a job like that going off unattended is how a bill arrives with no story
 * attached (CLAUDE.md rule 7).
 *
 * Three properties hold it together:
 *
 * - **Resumable.** The work is written down as cells before any of it is attempted, each
 *   cell is claimed and marked as it goes, and a process that dies leaves a truthful
 *   record of what still needs doing. Resuming regenerates nothing that was paid for.
 * - **Capped.** Before every model call the run's spend is read out of `ai_calls` and the
 *   run pauses if the next call might exceed its budget. See [PoolSpendCap].
 * - **Labelled.** Every question goes through [PoolAssociationGate] on the way in, so no
 *   claim the model makes about a real employer survives without the separate answer that
 *   licensed it — and the withdrawals are counted, because a generator whose claims are
 *   being withdrawn nine times in ten is a generator with a broken prompt.
