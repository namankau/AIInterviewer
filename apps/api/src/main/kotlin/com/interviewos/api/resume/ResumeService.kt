/**
 * Uploading a resume, reading it, and turning it into something an interviewer can use.
 *
 * Parsing is **synchronous** here, unlike the interviewer's voice. The candidate is
 * sitting on an upload screen waiting to find out whether we understood their resume, and
 * an answer they have to come back for is worse than a wait they can see. It is one call,
 * it happens once, and nothing else is blocked by it.
 *
 * The rule that governs everything below: **what the resume says is the candidate's, and
 * what we derived is ours.** The model extracts only what the document states and flags
 * what it was unsure of; totals, gaps and short tenures are computed from the dates by
 * [ResumeTimeline] rather than asked for, because a model asked to add up durations will
 * produce a plausible number instead of a correct one.
