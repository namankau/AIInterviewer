          {LEGAL.productName} provides self-paced courses, practice questions, AI-led mock
          interviews and feedback reports. The interviewer is an AI system, not a person. The
          service does not conduct real hiring assessments or act for any employer.

            Feedback and scores are written by an AI model. They can be wrong and are meant to help

            affiliated with any employer named on the site, and their names belong to them.
