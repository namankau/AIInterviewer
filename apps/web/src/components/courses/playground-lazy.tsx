/**
 * `ssr: false` only works from inside a Client Component (Next's rule, not a choice) —
 * which is the whole point of this file existing separately from `playground.tsx`.
 *
 * `block-renderer.tsx` is a Server Component and can import this wrapper normally, the
 * same way it imports `QuizBlock`/`VizBlock`. But *this* file's own `dynamic()` call is
 * what actually keeps CodeMirror and both language grammars out of the bundle a chapter
 * needs for its first paint and hydration: with `ssr: false`, Next does not need that
 * chunk to render or hydrate the page, so it is never folded into the one shared client
 * bundle every chapter under `/courses/[course]/[chapter]` otherwise loads — confirmed by
 * measuring the built output (see task 049's report): the same static import, without
 * `ssr: false`, measured byte-for-byte identical whether or not a chapter had a
 * playground block at all, because Next's SSR pass still needed the module to render the
 * initial HTML. The starter code and expected output are already real, server-rendered
 * text one level up in `block-renderer.tsx` — this component is purely the interactive
 * enhancement on top of that, so losing its SSR output costs nothing a search engine or a
 * no-JS reader was relying on.
