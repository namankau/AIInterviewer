/**
 * The antechamber, run as a pre-flight rather than a status panel.
 *
 * Nobody should discover a dead microphone thirty seconds into a round they set aside
 * half an hour for. But the older version of this screen only *reported* — it said the
 * microphone was ready the instant the browser handed over a track, which is not the same
 * claim at all: a muted headset, a microphone captured by another app, and speakers turned
 * to zero all pass that test and all ruin the round.
 *
 * So every check here is something actually attempted, one at a time, in the order a
 * candidate would attempt them. The meter has to genuinely move before the microphone is
 * called working. The interviewer's voice is genuinely spoken aloud, so the candidate hears
 * it here rather than discovering in the room that their volume was down. Nothing is a
 * green tick because a capability exists — only because it was exercised.
 *
 * Running them in sequence is not decoration either. Four spinners resolving at once is a
 * loading screen; one thing at a time, each settling before the next begins, is a person
 * being walked through it, and this screen's other job is to settle someone's nerves.
 *
 * **Only the microphone gates entry.** No local voice and no live transcript are ordinary
 * facts about a browser, not faults, and the round runs regardless — a check that blocked
 * on them would be inventing a requirement the product does not have.
 *
 * Entering is a click, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental: a browser refuses
 * to play audio with sound until the document has been interacted with, so without a
 * deliberate press the first question is synthesised, stored, served, and then silently
 * swallowed by the tab. It is also why the voice check offers a replay button — the same
 * refusal can hold back the check's own hello, and the way out of it is a press.
