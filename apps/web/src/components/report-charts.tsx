/**
 * The marking scale, drawn.
 *
 * These two graphics exist because of one number. The report's scoring was recalibrated
 * to be genuinely demanding — 2 out of 5 is the *default* for a competent, ordinary
 * answer, which means an ordinary round now comes out at 40%. A candidate who has only
 * ever seen a percentage on a school paper reads 40% as a fail, and a report that opens
 * with a fail is one they close. The recalibration was worth doing precisely because it
 * leaves room above the middle for improvement to be visible; showing it as a bare
 * percentage, or as a gauge that is 60% empty, throws that away in the first second of
 * reading.
 *
 * So neither of these draws a "how full" bar for the overall score. The scale is drawn as
 * an instrument with its zones named, and the candidate is a mark on it. Nothing is empty,
 * because nothing was ever supposed to be full.
