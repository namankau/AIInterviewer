/**
 * AI and Agentic AI (task 057). The third course, alongside `java` and `dsa`, and the
 * first whose code is Python — hence `codeLanguage`.
 *
 * Every non-obvious claim in this course is grounded in an openly published source, named
 * in the chapter that uses it: the ReAct paper (arXiv:2210.03629), Anthropic's *Building
 * Effective Agents*, the Model Context Protocol specification, chain-of-thought prompting
 * (arXiv:2201.11903), RAG (arXiv:2005.11401), *Attention Is All You Need*
 * (arXiv:1706.03762), *Lost in the Middle* (arXiv:2307.03172), *Why Language Models
 * Hallucinate* (arXiv:2509.04664), the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications, and the open
 * documentation of LangGraph, the OpenAI Agents SDK and smolagents. CLAUDE.md holds a
 * claim about a named framework or model to the same bar as a claim about a named
 * employer: sourced, or not made. Where the text describes a general pattern rather than a
 * specific system, it says so.
 *
 * The agent lab (module 3) is a **scripted local simulation** and says so on its face. No
 * chapter in this course, and no code path it reaches, calls a model — CLAUDE.md rule 7.
