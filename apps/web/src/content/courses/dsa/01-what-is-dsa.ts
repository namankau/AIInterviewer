        "Imagine a kitchen where every utensil, spice, and vessel gets dropped into one giant drawer, in no " +

        "it works, but it gets slower as the drawer fills up. Now imagine the same kitchen with labelled " +
        "spice racks, a knife block, and shelves grouped by use: finding the cumin means going straight to " +
        "the spice rack and reading the label. Nothing about *what's in the kitchen* changed — only how it " +
        "is **organised** — and that organisation is the entire difference between a ten-second search and " +
        "a two-minute one. A **data structure** is a deliberate choice of organisation (the spice rack, the " +
        "knife block, the drawer); an **algorithm** is the step-by-step procedure you follow using that " +
        "organisation (scan the drawer front to back; or go straight to the labelled shelf). Where the " +
        "analogy stops: a kitchen's organisation is chosen once and barely changes; a program often builds " +
