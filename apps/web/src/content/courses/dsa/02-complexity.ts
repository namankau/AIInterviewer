        "find the name or run out of seats — in the worst case (the student is in the last seat, or " +
        "absent), that's n checks. Method two: the hall is pre-sorted by roll number and pinned on a " +
        "seating chart at the door, so you jump to the middle, decide \"higher or lower\", and repeat — " +
        "each check eliminates half the remaining seats, needing only around log₂(n) checks. Double the " +
