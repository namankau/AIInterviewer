        "Imagine a gym that assigns each member a locker not by queue order, but by a fixed formula applied " +
        "to their membership number — say, membership number mod 100 gives the locker number. Finding your " +
        "locker never means checking every locker in the room: you compute the formula once and walk " +
        "straight there. That formula is a **hash function**: it turns a key (the membership number, or a " +
        "string like \"cat\") into a fixed 'bucket' index. The catch: two different membership numbers can " +
        "land on the *same* locker number by the formula (137 mod 100 and 237 mod 100 both give 37) — " +
        "that's a **collision**, and the gym has to have a plan for it (a small shelf inside locker 37 that " +
        "holds more than one bag). A `HashMap` does exactly this: it hashes the key to a bucket index, and " +
        "when two keys land in the same bucket, it keeps a short list there instead of overwriting. Where " +
        "the analogy stops: a gym's locker count is fixed; a `HashMap` grows its bucket count automatically " +
