        "Picture sorting a hand of playing cards three different ways. **Bubble sort**: repeatedly scan the " +
        "hand left to right, swapping any two adjacent cards that are out of order — after one full scan, " +
        "the largest card has 'bubbled' all the way to the end, so each pass needs to check one card fewer. " +
        "**Selection sort**: for the current leftmost unsorted position, scan the *entire* remaining hand to " +
        "find the smallest card, and swap it into place — one decisive placement per pass, rather than many " +
        "small swaps. **Insertion sort**: pick up cards one at a time from the unsorted pile and slide each " +
        "one into its correct position among the cards already sorted in your hand — the way most people " +
        "actually sort a hand of cards dealt to them. All three reach the same sorted hand; they scan and " +
        "move cards in genuinely different patterns to get there. Where the analogy stops: a person sorting " +
        "real cards can glance at the whole hand at once; each of these algorithms is restricted to " +
