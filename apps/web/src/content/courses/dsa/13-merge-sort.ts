        "Suppose two teaching assistants have each separately sorted their own stack of exam papers by roll " +
        "number. Combining the two stacks into one sorted stack doesn't require re-sorting everything — you " +
        "just compare the top paper of each stack, take whichever has the lower roll number, and repeat; " +
        "once one stack runs out, the rest of the other stack is already in order and gets appended " +
        "directly. This **merge** step is a single pass, comparing at most once per paper across both " +
        "stacks. Merge sort's insight is to get *to* two sorted stacks by splitting one big unsorted stack " +
        "in half, recursively sorting each half the exact same way, down to stacks of one paper (already " +
        "sorted, trivially), then merging pairs of sorted stacks back together, over and over, until one " +
        "fully sorted stack remains. Where the analogy stops: merging two real paper stacks needs a second, " +
