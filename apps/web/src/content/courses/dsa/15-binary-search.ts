      answer: 1,
      why:
        "Binary search relies on being able to safely discard half the remaining range based on one " +

        "It's a bug — it should always be mid - 1, matching the plain binarySearch example",

        "It only affects performance, not correctness",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why:
        "Because the goal is the smallest qualifying value, a mid that already satisfies the condition is " +
        "a candidate answer itself and must remain in play — excluding it with mid - 1 could skip past the " +
        "true answer, unlike plain binarySearch where an exact non-match is safely excludable.",
