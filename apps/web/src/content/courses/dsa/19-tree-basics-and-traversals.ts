        "Explain how level order traversal could be adapted to print the tree level by level, on separate " +
          "lines, rather than as one flat list — what extra bookkeeping does the queue need?",

          "same values, using any traversal you choose, and explain your choice.",

      question: "Why does inorder traversal visit a binary search tree's nodes in ascending sorted order?",
      options: [
        "Java automatically sorts tree nodes during traversal",
        "Because inorder always visits the entire left subtree (all smaller values, by BST rule) before the " +
          "node itself, then the entire right subtree (all larger values) — recursively true at every node",
        "It's a coincidence specific to the example tree in this chapter",
        "Inorder only works on already-sorted trees",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why:
        "A BST's defining rule is that every left subtree holds smaller values and every right subtree " +
        "holds larger ones; inorder's left-self-right order directly mirrors that rule at every node, " +
        "recursively, producing sorted output.",

      question: "Which traversal visits a node only after both of its children have already been visited?",
      options: ["Preorder", "Inorder", "Postorder", "Level order"],
      answer: 2,
      why:
        "Postorder is left, right, self — the node itself is added to the output only after its entire " +
        "left and right subtrees are already done, which is why it's used for bottom-up computations like " +
        "tree height.",
    },
    {
      kind: "quiz",
      question: "Why does level order traversal require a queue rather than recursion?",
      options: [
        "It's just a stylistic preference — recursion would work identically",
        "Because level order needs to process nodes in the exact order they're discovered across the whole " +
          "tree (FIFO), which is what a queue provides; recursion naturally goes deep first, not row by row",
        "Queues are always faster than recursive calls in Java",
        "Recursion cannot visit tree nodes at all",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why:
        "Recursion follows the call stack (LIFO), naturally diving deep before backtracking. Level order " +
        "needs strict row-by-row, left-to-right order, which is exactly what enqueueing children and " +
        "dequeueing in arrival order (FIFO) guarantees.",
