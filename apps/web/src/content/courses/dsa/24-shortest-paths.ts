    "On an unweighted graph, BFS's ring-by-ring order already gives the shortest path for free. Add " +

        "The previous chapter noted that BFS explores in expanding rings — everything one edge away, then " +
        "two edges away, and so on. That ordering has a direct consequence worth stating precisely: **on an " +
        "unweighted graph, the first time BFS reaches a vertex, it has done so by the fewest possible number " +
        "of edges.** No extra bookkeeping needed — the shortest path (in edge count) falls straight out of " +
        "the traversal order. The moment edges carry different **weights** (a road's actual distance, a " +
        "flight's cost), that stops being true: a path with more edges can still be shorter in total weight " +
        "than a path with fewer. That's exactly the gap **Dijkstra's algorithm** closes.",

        "BFS on an unweighted graph is like ripples spreading from a dropped stone: they reach every point at " +
        "distance 1 before any point at distance 2, because every 'step' costs the same. Weighted shortest " +
        "paths are more like a search party where each person's stride costs a different amount of effort — " +
        "you can't just count steps taken; you have to track cumulative effort spent, and always send the " +
        "next searcher from whoever has spent the *least* effort so far, because someone who's spent more " +
        "might still find a cheaper way through their own path. That's Dijkstra's core discipline: always " +
        "expand from the cheapest known but not-yet-finalised vertex. Where the analogy stops: ripples never " +

      question: "Why does Dijkstra's algorithm produce incorrect results on graphs with negative edge weights?",
      options: [
        "Java's PriorityQueue cannot store negative numbers",
        "Dijkstra assumes that once a vertex is finalised with its shortest distance, no later path can " +
          "improve it — a negative edge can violate this by making a longer-looking path suddenly cheaper " +
          "after that vertex was already finalised",
        "Negative weights cause an infinite loop, not a wrong answer",
        "It doesn't — Dijkstra handles negative weights correctly as long as there's no negative cycle",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why:
        "Dijkstra's greedy correctness relies on distances only ever growing as you extend a path with " +
        "non-negative edges. A negative edge can make an already-finalised vertex's true shortest distance " +
        "smaller than what was recorded, which the algorithm has no mechanism to revisit.",
    },
  ],
