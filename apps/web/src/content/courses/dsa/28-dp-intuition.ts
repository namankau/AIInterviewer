        "Imagine ten classmates separately ask you the same tricky homework question over the course of an " +
        "afternoon. Working it out from scratch every single time is naive recursion — correct, but wasteful. " +
        "The obvious fix: solve it once, write the answer on a sticky note stuck to your desk, and the next " +
        "nine times just read the note. That sticky note is exactly what a **memo** (memoization) is. " +
        "**Tabulation** is the same idea from the opposite direction: instead of waiting to be asked and " +
        "caching answers reactively, you sit down beforehand and fill out an answer sheet for every question " +
        "from the easiest to the hardest, in order, so that by the time a hard question is reached, every " +
        "smaller thing it depends on is already filled in. Where the analogy stops: real sticky notes can be " +
