        "You're packing one bag with a hard weight limit, choosing from items each with its own weight and " +
        "usefulness, and each item can go in at most once (you own only one of each). For every item, in " +
        "turn, you face one decision: leave it out, or take it (if it still fits) and give up its weight " +
        "for the rest of your choices. The **0/1 knapsack** problem is exactly this, formalised: dp[i][w] " +
        "means 'the best total value achievable, deciding only among the first i items, with w weight " +
        "capacity remaining.' Every other pattern in this chapter is a variation on the same idea — a table " +
        "indexed by 'how much of the input have I considered' and some other dimension, filled by a rule " +
        "that reuses smaller answers already computed. Where the analogy stops: a real bag-packing decision " +
        "is made once, by feel; the DP table explores every combination systematically, which is exactly " +
