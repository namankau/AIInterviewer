      why:

      question: "Why is Java described as neither purely compiled nor purely interpreted?",

        "Because Java has no compiler at all, only an interpreter.",
        "Because `javac` compiles source to bytecode, and the JVM then interprets (and further " +
          "optimises) that bytecode at run time — both steps happen.",
        "Because different companies build Java differently, so it depends on the vendor.",
        "Because Java code runs directly on the processor with no intermediate step.",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why:
        "Compilation happens once, ahead of time, producing bytecode. Interpretation (plus further " +
        "just-in-time compilation for speed) happens every time that bytecode runs, inside the JVM. It's " +
        "a two-stage pipeline, which is exactly what makes it portable *and* reasonably fast.",
