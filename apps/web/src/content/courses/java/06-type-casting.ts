        "Pouring dal from a small katori into a large steel bowl is always safe — the large bowl has " +

        "bigger container: always safe, so Java does it automatically, with no cast needed. **Narrowing** — " +
        "`double` to `int`, `int` to `byte` — is pouring into a smaller container: it *might* overflow, so " +

        "signature confirming you understand the risk. Where the analogy stops: dal that overflows a bowl " +
        "is visibly gone; a narrowed value that overflows doesn't disappear so obviously — it wraps around " +
