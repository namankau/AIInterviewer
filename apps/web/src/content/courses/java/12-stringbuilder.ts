        "Imagine you're told to build up a sentence one word at a time, but with an unusual rule: every " +

        "the new word at the end, then throw the old page away. Add ten words, and you've copied out ten " +
        "increasingly long sentences, most of whose content you'd already written before — enormously " +
        "wasteful. That's exactly what `result = result + i;` does inside a loop: because `String` is " +
        "immutable, each `+` creates an entirely new String containing everything before it, plus the new " +
