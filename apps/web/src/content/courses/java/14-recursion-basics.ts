        "To find out how many dolls are inside a set of Russian nesting dolls, you don't need a special " +
        "counting procedure for \"a set of dolls\" — you only need one rule, applied repeatedly: \"open the " +
        "current doll; if there's a smaller doll inside, the count is 1 plus the count of *that* smaller " +
        "set; if there's nothing inside, the count is 1 and you stop.\" You apply the exact same rule to " +
        "the smaller doll, and the smaller one after that, until you reach a doll with nothing inside — " +
        "the point where the rule stops asking you to open another doll and simply gives you an answer. " +
        "That final, no-further-opening case is the **base case**; every step before it is the " +

        "0-factorial is just 1, no further multiplying needed.\" Where the analogy stops: opening a real " +
        "doll physically produces a smaller doll whether you like it or not; a recursive method only " +
        "shrinks the problem if *you* write it to shrink — get the smaller version wrong, or forget the " +
