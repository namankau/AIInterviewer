        "At a tea stall, saying \"tea\" alone gets you the default; saying \"tea, no sugar\" gets a " +
        "different, specific preparation — the stall picks which recipe to follow based on exactly what you " +
        "said, decided the moment you speak. That's **overloading**: several methods sharing a name, " +
        "distinguished by their parameter list, and the compiler picks which one to run by looking at what " +
        "you wrote in the code — a decision made at compile time, before the program even runs. Compare " +
        "that to a substitute teacher: a class is announced simply as \"Period 3, Science\" — nobody in the " +
        "timetable says in advance *which* teacher's specific style of teaching Science will show up; it " +
        "depends on who actually walks in that day. That's **overriding**: a subclass supplies its own " +
        "version of an inherited method, and Java decides *at run time*, by looking at the actual object " +
        "(the teacher who actually walked in), which version to run — not by looking at the variable's " +

        "genuinely different mechanisms in Java, not just different timing — overloading is resolved by " +
