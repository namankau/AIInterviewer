        "A train's printed reservation chart lists every seat, numbered, on one continuous sheet: to find " +
        "seat 47, you go directly to position 47 — instant, because it's all one contiguous layout. But " +
        "inserting a new passenger at position 10 means physically reprinting the chart with everyone " +
        "after seat 10 shifted down by one seat. That's `ArrayList`: elements sit in one contiguous block of " +
        "memory, so `get(index)` jumps straight there instantly, but inserting or removing in the middle " +
        "means shifting every element after it. Now picture a treasure hunt instead: clue 1 tells you where " +
        "to physically walk to find clue 2, clue 2 points to clue 3, and so on — there's no way to jump " +
        "straight to \"clue 47\" without walking the whole chain from the start. But inserting a brand-new " +
        "clue between two existing ones is trivial: just repoint two arrows, no walking anything shifted at " +
        "all. That's `LinkedList`: each element (**node**) stores a link to the next one; reaching `get(47)` " +
        "means walking 47 links one at a time, but inserting/removing at a *known* position — especially the " +
        "front or back — touches only a couple of links, nothing shifts. Where the analogy stops: a real " +
