        "Picture a library that doesn't search shelf by shelf for a book — instead, every book's title runs " +
        "through a fixed formula that spits out a shelf number, and the book always goes on exactly that " +
        "shelf. To find a book again, you run its title through the same formula, get the same shelf " +
        "number, and walk straight there — no searching required. That formula is a **hash function**, and " +
        "the shelf number is a **hash code**. A `HashMap` (or `HashSet`) works the same way: every key runs " +
        "through `.hashCode()`, which decides which internal \"shelf\" (bucket) it lands on, so `get()` can " +
        "jump almost straight to the right bucket instead of checking every entry one by one. The catch: if " +
        "two different-looking books are actually *the same edition* (two `Point` objects both meaning " +
        "`(1,2)`), the library needs them to land on the *same* shelf and be recognised as duplicates — " +
        "which only works if the formula (`hashCode()`) and the \"are these actually the same book?\" check " +
        "(`equals()`) **agree** with each other. Where the analogy stops: a real librarian would eyeball two " +
        "identical books and just know; Java has no such judgement — it relies entirely on whatever " +
