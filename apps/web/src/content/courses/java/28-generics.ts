        "Imagine one standard storage box design used all over a warehouse — same size, same lid, same " +

        "allowed to go in and what you can trust to come back out. A **generic class** is exactly this: " +
        "`class Box<T> { T content; ... }` is the one box design, written once, with `T` standing in for " +

        "box labelled \"String only\"; `Box<Integer>` is a completely separate label on the exact same " +
