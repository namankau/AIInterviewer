      text:
        "A shop with two cashiers and two separate queues, each cashier handling their own customers " +
        "independently, gets through customers roughly twice as fast — the two cashiers barely need to " +
        "interact. That's the easy, safe case for threads: independent work, no shared data. Now imagine " +
        "both cashiers sharing one single cash drawer, each reading the current total, adding a sale, and " +
        "writing the new total back — if both read the same starting total *at the same instant*, then both " +
        "write back their own updated total, one cashier's sale can silently vanish from the total, even " +
        "though both genuinely rang up a sale. That's a **race condition**: two threads reading and writing " +
        "shared state without coordination, producing a result that depends on unlucky timing rather than " +
        "the actual logic. `synchronized` is the fix — it's the rule \"only one cashier may touch the " +
        "drawer at a time; the other must wait their turn\" — and it's exactly what the `Counter` class below " +
        "enforces on its `count` field. Where the analogy stops: a race condition in code doesn't announce " +
        "itself with an obvious complaint the way a confused cashier might — it can pass every test that " +
