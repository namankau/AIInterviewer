        "Picture a factory conveyor belt: raw items go in one end, pass a filtering station that removes " +
        "defective ones, then a shaping station that transforms each surviving item, then a sorting " +
        "station, and finally a packing station that boxes up the result. Each station does exactly one " +
        "job and hands its output to the next; nobody at the shaping station needs to know or care how " +
        "filtering worked. A **Stream** is exactly this conveyor belt over a collection: `.filter(...)` is " +
        "the filtering station (keep only items matching a condition), `.map(...)` is the shaping station " +
        "(transform each item into something else), `.sorted()` is the sorting station, and `.collect(...)` " +
        "is the packing station that gathers the final result back into a real `List`. Where the analogy " +
        "stops: a factory belt physically moves items through every station one after another; a Java " +
        "stream is actually **lazy** — none of the intermediate stations (`filter`, `map`, `sorted`) do any " +
