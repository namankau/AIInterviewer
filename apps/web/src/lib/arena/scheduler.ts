 * The one place `ts-fsrs` is imported (task 055) — everything else in the Arena talks to
 * `ReviewState`, a plain, JSON-serialisable record, so the scheduling library can be
 * swapped later without touching storage or the session UI.
 *
 * FSRS's own grades are Again/Hard/Good/Easy. A quiz-style challenge only ever tells us
 * right or wrong, so this wrapper deliberately narrows to two of the four: wrong maps to
 * `Again` (forgotten, needs to come back soon) and right maps to `Good` (recalled
 * correctly, needs no special handling). Never `Hard` or `Easy` — we have no honest signal
 * for "recalled but it was a struggle" versus "trivial", and guessing would just be
 * inventing precision the interaction doesn't support.
