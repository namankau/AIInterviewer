 * Every kind of challenge the Arena can pose, and exactly what existing course content
 * each one is derived from (task 055). There is no seventh kind that hand-authors new
 * material — see `derive.ts`.
 *
 * - `mcq` — a `quiz` block, unchanged.
 * - `predict-output` — a `code` block with a real, pasted `output`, or a `playground`
 *   block with an `expectedOutput`. The learner is shown the source and asked what it
 *   prints, rather than being handed a live interpreter mid-run (that stays on the
 *   chapter page, where a wrong run costs nothing and there is no timer).
 * - `spot-mistake` — one item of a `pitfall` block, split on its own " — " into the
 *   mistake and the explanation of why it matters; the explanation is the answer.
 * - `which-column` — one item of a `compare` block; the answer is which column it
 *   actually belongs to.
 * - `what-next` — one frame of a `viz`; the learner is shown frame N and asked what the
 *   next frame's note says.
