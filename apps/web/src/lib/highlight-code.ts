/**
 * Server/build-time syntax highlighting for static course code (task 049).
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a client component: `codeToHtml` runs once, on the server, while a
 * chapter page is being generated, and its output is plain HTML with inline `--shiki-*`
 * colour variables — no highlighter, grammar, or theme ships to the browser. The one thing
 * every call must survive is an unfamiliar language string; a bad chapter or a Shiki
 * version bump should degrade to plain, unhighlighted code, never break the build or the
 * page (`BlockRenderer` falls back to a plain `<pre>` when this returns `null`).
 *
 * Both themes are baked into every call — light and dark — because the product has no
 * class-based theme switch: `globals.css` reacts to `prefers-color-scheme` alone, and the
 * generated HTML needs to do the same (see the `.shiki` rules there).

 * `java` until a course arrived whose code is not Java, at which point the name was a
 * quiet lie about what it held.
